# Ripple Foundation - A History

Our global mission is to support the adoption of an open platform for healthcare and to develop key OSS components to enable this change. We advocate competing on a SaaS basis, to provide the best tools to serve clinicians, so they can in turn improve the health of patients.

# Funding model

Ripple Foundation is committed to offering free and open software, with quality, free and open documentation, but unfortunately is unable to offer free support for all issues/pull requests. We offer consultancy services to support organisations on their open platform journey.

Our latest thinking on the best model to support our open platform mission in healthcare may best be understood by reading this article. https://opensource.com/business/16/4/refactoring-open-source-business-models

If you would like to offer some of your energy/ suggest other ideas towards progressing an open platform in healthcare, please contact us at info@ripple.foundation )
